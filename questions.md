- To use rapidity and transverse momentum binned data, the luminosity and cross section being commom factors, i want to express the ratio of the peaks by using the rapidity and transverse momentum data
- Is the number of bins for the mass histogram large enough, it is very boxy, but we use the same method for all data sets for the bin width determination (freedman method)
