- how do i get iminuit and root packages installed (found a way to have an inbuilt crystal ball func for both but cant get them to run on Spyder (should i use a diffrent emulator)
- For the double gaussian fit, to make the transition smoother, could I take the average of:
```
np.mean([tail_1st[-1] center[0]]) and np.mean([tail_2nd[0] center[-1]])
```
- When you say 2d plot of 2-dimensional plots of the additional observables vs the invariant mass is that plotting the histograms of the mass versus of the momentum
