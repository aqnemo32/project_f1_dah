# project_f1_dah

Project F1 for the Data Acquisition course

IMPORTANT FILES

The Python script that does all the fitting and contains all the results is the pyroot_test.py (Requires ROOT, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and freedman from funtions)

The work through for cleaning the data using transverse momenta is in data_cleaning.ipynb (Requires numpy and matplotlib.pyplot)

all histograms not made in pyroot are produced and contained within histogram_2d_ups.py and histograms.py

file_handle.py should not be necessary as all numpy arrays are saved in folders wthin the repo. To check if it works you are expected to have access to one of .bin files provided in the DAH dropbox or a file of a similar format.

LESS IMPORTANT

The file named functions has all the functions used for the iminuit_test.ipynb, analysis.py and iminuit_probfit_test
